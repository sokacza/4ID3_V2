# About

## Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the 4ID3 IoT Devices & Networks lab component! My name is Adam Sokacz and I am an Automation graduate from the class of 2023. I have a passion for software development and using these tools to build real-world solutions! Apart from that, I'm an avid cycIist and love biking and hiking the amazing trails around Hamilton and throughout the golden horseshoe. I have had the extraordinary opportunity to be a part of the course revamp and restructure many of the lab experiments that you will be doing this semester.&#x20;
